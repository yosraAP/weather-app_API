## Weather App Montreal

- This marks my first venture into using an API. The application employs JavaScript and Axios to communicate with the API and retrieve data in JSON format. Subsequently, JavaScript functions process this data to display it in the web application, which is built using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap for layout and styling.

- The app allows users to check the weather worldwide and in their current location. 

- It also provides the option to display temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
